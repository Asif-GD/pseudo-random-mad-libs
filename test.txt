The Fun Park!
Today, my fabulous camp group went to a (an) {adjective_1} amusement park. It was a
fun park with lots of cool {noun_1} (plural) and enjoyable play structures. When we got there, my
kind counselor shouted in a high voice, "Everybody off the {noun_2}." We all pushed out in a terrible hurry.
My counselor handed out {adjective_2} (color) tickets, and we scurried in. I was so excited! I couldn't figure out
what exciting thing to do first. I saw a scary {noun_3} (name of a ride) I really liked so, I quickly ran
over to get in the long line that had about 50 people in it. When I finally
got on the ride I was {verb_1} (past tense). In fact, I was so nervous my two knees
were knocking together. This was the {adjective_3} (superlative) ride I had ever been on! In about two
minutes I heard the crank and grinding of the gears. Thatâ€™s when the ride began! When I got to the bottom,
I was a little {verb_2} (past tense) but I was proud of myself. We broke for lunch. My mom had packed me {noun_4} (food) for lunch.
The rest of the day went by fast. It was a(n) {adjective_4} day at the fun park.
