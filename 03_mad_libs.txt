The First Day of {noun_2}
One very nice morning near the end of summer, my mother woke me up at 4:00 A.M. and said, "Wake up and smell the grass,
sleepy head! Today is your first day of {noun_2}, and you can't be late." I groaned in my bed for twenty seconds,
but eventually I started getting ready for {noun_2}. I wore a blue and white striped, long sleeve shirt with a collar on it,
a {adjective_1} tie, dark gray pants, white socks, black shoes, and a hat. In ten minutes I made lunch and ate my breakfast.
I was ready and waiting for the bus. A few minutes later, the bus came, and I waved 'bye' to mom as I was boarding
the bus to {noun_2}. On the way to {noun_2}, I saw a lots of {noun_5}(s).

In {noun_2}, I met two really fun kids in the {adjective_2} corridor. All of us became friends very fast. That day we had Science,
and luckily my friends and I were at the same {noun_2}. My friends' names are {noun_4} and Shelly. In Math, we weren't together,
and that really bugged me. We learned what algebra was, and when to use them. At snack and recess, we played a game
together. It was extremely fun. At P. E., we were {verb_4} off of the ropes. I thought it was a very interesting idea.
In swimming class, we needed to swim extremely fast, or else we would have to swim longer.

Before I knew it, {noun_2} was over. I grabbed all my belongings and put them into my backpack and {verb_1} to the waiting
area for the bus. In two minutes, the bus came. As I stepped into the bus I shouted, "Goodbye, adios amigos, and shalom,"
to my friends. Then I went into the bus. In a flash, I was back home. This day was the {adjective_3} day of my life!
