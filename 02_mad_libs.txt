A Day At The Amusement Park!
Today, my fabulous camp group went to a (an) {adjective_2} amusement park. It was a fun park with lots of cool {noun_1}
and enjoyable play structures. When we got there, my kind counselor shouted in a high voice,
'Everybody off the {noun_2}.' We all pushed out in a terrible hurry. My counselor handed out {adjective_1} tickets,
and we scurried in. I was so {verb_3}! I couldn't figure out what exciting thing to do first. I saw a scary {noun_4}
I really liked so, I quickly ran over to get in the long line that had about 50 people in it. When I finally
got on the ride I was very nervous. In fact, I was so nervous my two knees were knocking together.
This was the {adjective_3} ride I had ever been on! In about two minutes I heard the crank and grinding of the gears.
Thatâ€™s when the ride began! When I got to the bottom, I was a little {verb_2} but I was proud of myself.
We broke for lunch. My mom had packed me {noun_3} for lunch. The rest of the day went by fast.
It was a(n) {adjective_4} day at the fun park.
